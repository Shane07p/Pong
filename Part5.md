## 🏆 Part 5: Add Scoring System 

### 🎯 Objective
Add scoring and create a complete playable game loop where players can win or lose.

### ✨ Features Implemented
- Introduced `playerScore` and `aiScore` to track scores 
- Added a reset mechanism to reposition the ball after each point 
- Displayed scores on screen using canvas text rendering 
- Implemented score detection:
  - Player scores when ball goes off the top
  - AI scores when ball goes off the bottom

### ⚙️ How It Works
- Ball crossing top/bottom edge awards point to opponent
- Ball resets to center after each point
- Scores displayed at center of screen

## 🤖 Computer AI Implementation 

### 🧩 General Strategy
Two-part AI system:
1. **Reaction Time**: Artificial delay before responding
2. **Accuracy**: Random error factor in predictions

### 🎚️ Difficulty Levels
```js
Levels: [
  {aiReaction: 0.2, aiError: 40},   // 0: ai is losing by 8
  {aiReaction: 0.3, aiError: 50},   // 1: ai is losing by 7
  // ... (other levels)
  {aiReaction: 1.8, aiError: 200}   // 16: ai is winning by 8
]
